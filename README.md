## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- ViteJS

### What I learned
- e.target.getAttribute("data-value"); Instead of e.target.value; Where a value attribute was on a list item, which is not allowed on this element.
- That border-radius: 9999px; gives you a pill shaped button.


### Continued development
- I will probably convert this project to React at some point.


### Useful resources

- [HTML & CSS validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea) - To validate my HTML and CSS
